# Archivesspace Client

Interact with ArchivesSpace via the API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'archivesspace-client'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install archivesspace-client
```

## Usage

See the examples directory for a range of use cases.

**Default configuration**

Create client with default settings (`localhost:8089`, `admin`, `admin`):

```ruby
client = ArchivesSpace::Client.new.login
```

**Custom configuration**

```ruby
config = ArchivesSpace::Configuration.new({
  base_uri: "https://archives.university.edu/staff/api",
  base_repo: "",
  username: "admin",
  password: "123456",
  page_size: 50,
  throttle: 0,
  verify_ssl: false,
  timeout: 60
})

client = ArchivesSpace::Client.new(config).login
```

**Making basic requests**

The client responds to the standard request methods:

```ruby
client.post('users', payload, { password: "abc123" }) # CREATE
client.get('users/5') # READ
client.post('users/5', payload) # UPDATE
client.delete('users/5') # DELETE

# these all defer to `request`
client.request('GET', 'users/5')

# to add params
client.get('users', { query: { all_ids: true } }).parsed

# using convenience methods
user = client.all('users').find { |user| user["username"] == "jdoe" }

# or even ...
user = client.users.find { |user| user["username"] == "jdoe" }
```

See `pagination.rb` for endpoints that support record type methods such as
`client.digital_objects` etc.

**Setting a repository context**

Use the `repository` method to add a repository scope to requests (this is optional).

```ruby
client.repository(2)
client.get('digital_objects', query: {page: 1}) # instead of "repositories/2/digital_objects" etc.

# to reset
client.repository(nil)
# or
client.use_global_repository
```

## Templates

Templates are an optional feature that can help simplify the effort of creating
json payloads for ArchivesSpace. Rather than construct the json programatically
according to the schemas a template can be used to generate payloads instead which
are transformed to json automatically. There are a small number of
templates provided with the client, but you can create your own and access them
by setting the `ARCHIVESSPACE_CLIENT_TEMPLATES_PATH` envvar. A particularly simple
`erb` template might look like:

```erb
{
  "digital_object_id": "<%= data[:digital_object_id] %>",
  "title": "<%= data[:title] %>"
}
```

Practically speaking there isn't much benefit to this example, but in the case of
a more complex record structure where you want to populate deeply nested elements
using a flat file structure (like csv) this can be a very convenient way of
assembling the payload. To process a template:

```ruby
data = { repo_code: 'ABC', name: 'ABC Archive', agent_contact_name: 'ABC Admin' }
json = ArchivesSpace::Template.process("repository_with_agent.json.erb", data)
response = client.post('/repositories/with_agent', json)
puts response.result.success? ? '=)' : '=('
```

To view available templates use: `ArchivesSpace::Template.list`

## CLI

Create an `~/.asclientrc` file with a json version of the client configuration:

```json
{
  "base_uri": "https://archives.university.edu/staff/api",
  "base_repo": "",
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "123456",
  "page_size": 50,
  "throttle": 0,
  "timeout": 60,
  "verify_ssl": false
}
```

Run commands:

```bash
# when using locally via the repo prefix commands with ./exe/ i.e. ./exe/asclient -v
asclient -v
```

## Development

To run the examples start a local instance of ArchivesSpace then:

```bash
bundle exec ruby examples/repo_and_user.rb
```

Any script placed in the examples directory with a `my_` prefix are ignored by
git. Follow the convention used by the existing scripts to bootstrap and
experiment away.

To run the tests:

```bash
bundle exec rake
```

## Publishing

When an updated version (`lib/archivesspace/client/version.rb`) is merged into the
main/master branch a new release will be built and published.
